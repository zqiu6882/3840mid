Demonstrates knowledge of the topic, explaining nuances/ alternatives. Then it will degrade from 40% if is fails to achieve that.\n",
        "  * Appearance: the remaining 10%. Structure in sections if needed. Properly sized cells (not too large code cells). Even mix of code cells and explanations instead of very few large cells. Code should be readable.\n"

        "* The exam will be a colab jupyter notebook that you have to fill in, then upload to canvas.\n",
        "\n",
        "* You will have **120 minutes** to do the exam. This is an **important point**, try to become familiar with the functions to run biogeme, pandas, numpy, etc. Even if you have full access to the material of the course and can look at online programming forums for python issues, it might take some extra time. You can also prepare your own auxiliary functions to reduce the 'verbosity' of raw biogeme code. We will see this in the practice notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The questions will be very similar to what you will see in this practice notebook.** The point of the exam is to prove that you can do a basic analysis with a multinomial logit and use biogeme as a tool. The differenciation from typical exercises vs exam will come mostly in the type of data, what variables are involved and the 'what-if scenarios' questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The answers should be technically correct, but **the explanation in the text cells should demonstrate knowledge** of what you are doing. Why did you make that decision?. For example, a variable transformation, why do you choose that particular one? Why do you choose to add that variable to the model? What do you think it is going to do? After the results: Are the results as expected? Please do not be afraid of being 'too obvious' when explaining something.\n",
        "When explaining coefficients, Do these have the expected sign?, What is the interpretation with respect to the reference alternative?\n",
        " A perfect code but no explanation will net you 50-60% of the marks. The opposite example, if you get stuck with a python issue but know 'conceptually' how to answer, writing a good text explanation and some pseudocode will potentially net you up to half marks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* There will be no data cleaning involved, and the dataset will have full availability, you can create a full availability dictionary to pass to biogeme by just setting all entries to 1. ` av = {1:1, 2:1, 3:1, ...}`. We will see this in the practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Please **do not to identify yourself explicitly in the anwers**, writing your name. Besides that, you are free to express yourself.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The 'visual appearance' part of the exam stands for a small percentage of the mark, 10%. Try to clarify, do not leave very large code cells followed/ preceded by large text cells, try to interleave them so it is more natural to follow. Section you answers if they become long or address different topics. Do not write very long outputs, for example do not print the full dataset. It is critical that the main part of each answer is cleary identified with its own text cell and code cell. The bad example would be a large text cell explaining all the steps and the a large code cell that prints the output, with the answers in the middle of the code. Of course, if your answer does not require code (it might happen) do not force a code chunk in. The way we will mark the visual part is to read the notebook and if something stands out in a negative sense, this subtracts points.\n",

The confusion matrix shows that the model is most accurate at predicting Charter Boat (Category 4) and Private Boat (Category 3) outcomes, with 247 and 202 correct predictions, respectively. However, it seems to struggle with Beach (Category 1) and Pier (Category 2), often misclassifying these as other categories—particularly confusing Beach with Pier and vice versa. The model is also prone to incorrectly classifying other categories as Charter Boat or Private Boat, as indicated by the higher off-diagonal entries in these columns. Overall, while the model captures some aspects of the choice behavior, there's considerable room for improvement, particularly in distinguishing between Beach and Pier options."

These small adjustments suggest that price sensitivity among low-income individuals may not be a dominant factor affecting choice in this market, or that the current model may not capture all relevant influences.

        "The model suggests an unexpected outcome: despite a cut in the capture rate by half for trips that go farther from the coast (both private and charter boats), the total revenue from fishing trips during the season actually increases from approximately 109,978 to 115,938 units of currency. One possible explanation could be that with a lower catch rate, people may be inclined to spend more on fishing trips to meet their desired catch, thereby driving up total revenue. Alternatively, it might be the case that the model's parameters don't adequately capture the true price and catch sensitivity across the different alternatives, and therefore might not be a reliable predictor in such scenarios. However, if we assume the model is accurate, it implies that poor weather conditions, surprisingly, could have a beneficial impact on total revenue, despite lowering the attractiveness of private and charter boat options in terms of catch rate."
